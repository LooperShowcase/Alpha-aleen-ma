By the age of 20, Pagani had designed and built his first F3 racer.The turning point in Pagani's life came when he was hired by Renault to improve the body of a racing car.

After having success on this small scale, Pagani visited Lamborghini and met with the company's chief technical director Giulio Alfieri. In 1982, he decided to move to Italy, and he was hired by Lamborghini. Pagani began working basic jobs such as sweeping floors; and in time he was able to work his way up the company.
